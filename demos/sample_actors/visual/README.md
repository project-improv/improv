# fastplotlib demo

This folder contains a sample_actor for visualizing the `minimal` demo. Data generated by the **generator** `actor` is sent via 
a queue to the **processor** `actor` that can be used to process the frames and send them via `zmq`. 
The `fastplotlib.ipynb` notebook then receives the most recent wave via `zmq` and displays it using 
[`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplothttps://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplotlib).

### Instructions

1. Swap the sample_processor actor here for the one in the minimial demo

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.**

Usage:

```bash
# cd to this dir
cd .../improv/demos/minimal

# start improv
improv run ./minimal.yaml

# call `setup` in the improv TUI
setup

# Run the cells in the jupyter notebook until you receive
# a plot that has a white cosine wave

# once the plot is ready call `run` in the improv TUI
run
```
