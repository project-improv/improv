# minimal demo

This folder contains a minimal demo for running improv. In this demo, data generated by the **generator** `actor` is 
stored in a data store and a key to the generated data is sent via a queue to the **processor** `actor` that accesses 
the data in the store and processes it. 

Usage:

```bash
# cd to this dir
cd .../improv/demos/minimal

# start improv
improv run ./minimal.yaml

# call `setup` in the improv TUI
setup

# call `run` in the improv TUI
run

# when you are ready to stop the process, call `stop` in the improv TUI
stop
```

## Visualization using `fastplotlib`

You can also run the minimal demo and visualize the generated data using `fastplotlib`.

As before, data is generated by the **generator** `actor` is stored in a data store and a key to the generated data is 
sent via a queue to the **processor** `actor` that accesses the data in the store and processes it. Additionally, the
`fastplotlib.ipynb` notebook then receives the most recent data via `zmq` and displays it using 
[`fastplotlib`](https://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplothttps://github.com/fastplotlib/fastplotlib).

### Instructions

1. Swap the **processor** `actor` found in `/improv/demos/sample_actors/visual/sample_processor.py` for the one in 
the minimal demo

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory.

Usage:

```bash
# cd to this dir
cd .../improv/demos/minimal

# start improv
improv run ./minimal.yaml

# call `setup` in the improv TUI
setup

# Run the cells in the jupyter notebook until you receive
# a plot that has a white cosine wave

# once the plot is ready call `run` in the improv TUI
run

# You should see the plot updating between a cosine and sine wave with different colors depending on 
# whether the frame number is even or odd

# when you are ready to stop the process, call `stop` in the improv TUI
stop
```

#### Note: The `fastplotlib.ipynb` can only be run in `jupyter lab`
